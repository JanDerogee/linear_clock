The linear clock is (from a mechanical point of view) very easy to
build. The concept of a pointer running down a straight line gives in
instant indication of the time without even reading the number next to
the dial. The left side of the scale is night and morning, the right
side of the scale is afternoon and evening. The simplicity of this
clock makes it ideal for children that can read clocks. But also for
authistic people (of which some have a distorded concept of time) this
clock could be of use.<br><enter><br>This
linear clockCassiopei is designed and made by me, but was only possible
by standing on the shoulders of the giant Arduino/ESP8266&nbsp; community.
Electronics is my passion and some of my projects I have put onto my
website. Feel free to visit my <a href="http://home.kpn.nl/bderogee1980/index.html">project page</a> to learn more about these projects. <br>
