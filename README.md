# linear_clock
A clock that shows time on a line instead of a circle.

Because sometimes, showing time in a different way can be easier.
Some people, mostly children have problems of reading time froma regular clock.
Times goes around in circles, but sometimes you just want to know where you are in a day.
This linear clock has one unique position for each moment of the day.
It is a true 24 hour clock. The night and morning are on the left of the scale, the afternoon and evening are on the right.
The clock reaches it highest point at the same time the sun does (well... theoretically, as this depends on your timezone).

The clock is simple in construction, requires just one single stepper motor and is based on an ESP8266 and a threaded rod.
